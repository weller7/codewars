// Task
// Your function takes two arguments:

//     current father's age (years)
//     current age of his son (years)

// Ð¡alculate how many years ago the father was twice as old as his son (or in how many years he will be twice as old).
// The answer is always greater or equal to 0, no matter if it was in the past or it is in the future.


// Examples:


//psedudo code

function twiceAsOld(dadYearsOld, sonYearsOld) {
    const twice = sonYearsOld*2

    const result = dadYearsOld - twice

    console.log (Math.abs(result))
  }

  twiceAsOld(55,30)
